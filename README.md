# Final Project

I built an ecommerce website using the React framework. 

The website is designed to allor users to easily browse and purchase various types of sweets. It features a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for customers to find what they're looking for. 

It includes a shopping cart feature, allowing customers to add products to their cart and review their selections before checking out. The checkout process is simple and streamlined, with a form that customers must complete to submit their orders.

I have attached some pictures and videos below to give you a glimpse of the content and design of my website. ( If you want to see more, you can access the website on https://sweetcake-bakery.netlify.app/)
