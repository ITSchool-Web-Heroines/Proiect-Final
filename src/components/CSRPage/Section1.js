                The Lippie Factory began with a craving begging to be satisfied: the need for clean beauty that performs to our (and
                your) high
                standards. With bold, look-at-me-now color and skin-loving ingredients, we’re all about making you look and feel
                damn
                good—no settling necessary.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our mission is to make clean beauty less…beige. Along with creating inclusive shade ranges, we’re committed to
                developing formulas with super-satisfying sensorial experiences that boldly feed your senses through color, flavor
                and
                texture. And, because we know you’ve got things to do, we make sure our products do what they say and are easy to
                use.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is The Lippie Factory. We can’t wait to show you what we’re made of.
